# Olympics Data Analysis SQL Project

This SQL project aims to analyze the Olympics dataset, which contains information about Olympic Games, athletes, countries, and medals won. The analysis involves querying the dataset to derive insights into various aspects of Olympic history.

## Introduction

The Olympics dataset consists of two tables: `olympics_history` and `olympics_history_noc_region`. The `olympics_history` table contains detailed information about Olympic events, including athlete details, event details, and medals won. The `olympics_history_noc_region` table provides information about National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and their regions.
